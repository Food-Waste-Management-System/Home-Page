# Food Waste Management System
## Problem Statement 
 - A huge increase can be seen in food waste. According to data provided by the Food and Agriculture
Organization (http://www.fao.org/food-loss-and-food-waste/flw-data), globally 1/3 of the food
produced for human consumption is wasted, which accounts for about 1.3 billion tones per year.
On the other hand, according to WHO 20% of the population face extreme food shortage. Hence
there is a need to come up with a solution that can avoid wastage of food and help feed the needy.

 - This Web-based Food Waste Management system can assist in collecting the leftover food from
hotels & restaurants to distribute among those in need. NGOs that are helping poor communities
to battle against starvation & malnutrition can raise a request for food supply from restaurants
through this application. Once the request is accepted, the NGOs can collect the food from the
restaurants for its distribution. In this way, this web-based food waste management system will
help restaurants to reduce food waste and will help in feeding the poor and needy people.


## Working of the Project
 - In this system, we have tried to reduce restaurant food wastage by giving waste food to
NGOs.
- NGOs will raise a request, in case of any leftover food restaurants have. This request is
sent to the restaurant manager of that particular restaurant.
- The NGO Manager then approves the request and assigns it to one of the NGO
employees for takeaway and forwards the request to the restaurant.
- The leftover food at the restaurant can be given to NGOs at the end of the day.
- The admin can track the history of restaurants and NGOs for the leftover foods.
